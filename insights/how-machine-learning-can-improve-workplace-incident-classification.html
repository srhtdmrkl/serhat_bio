                <p class="insight-date">May 29, 2025</p>
                <p>In my previous articles, I discussed the ESAW methodology - a standardized system for classifying
                    workplace safety incidents - and explored the role of diagnostic analytics in enhancing workplace
                    safety. Accurate incident classification is the cornerstone of effective analysis and prevention
                    strategies. Machine learning offers great potential to streamline and improve this critical task.
                </p>

                <h3>How Machine Learning Can Help</h3>
                <p>Arthur Samuel, a pioneer in artificial intelligence, defined machine learning as "the field of study
                    that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." In the context of
                    workplace safety, this means that machine learning algorithms can be used for a variety of
                    purposes. In this article, we will focus on how machine learning can be applied to the
                    classification of workplace incidents.</p>

                <p>This method of classification offers several advantages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improved Accuracy: Machine learning algorithms can often identify subtle patterns and
                        relationships in data that humans might miss, leading to more accurate classifications.</li>
                    <li>Increased Efficiency: Automating the classification process saves valuable time and resources,
                        allowing EHS professionals to focus on other critical tasks.</li>
                    <li>Objective Analysis: Machine learning models provide objective and consistent classifications,
                        reducing the potential for human bias or error.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Of course, all these advantages depend on how well the machine learning model is trained. This includes
                    factors such as the quality and quantity of the training data, the selection of appropriate
                    features, and the choice of the machine learning algorithm. When done correctly, however, machine
                    learning can be a powerful tool for improving the accuracy and efficiency of incident
                    classification.</p>

                <h3>Developing a Machine Learning Model for Incident Classification</h3>
                <p>Developing a machine learning model for incident classification involves a multi-stage process:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Data Collection and Preparation: The first step is to gather a large dataset of incident
                        reports, ensuring it is comprehensive, accurate, and representative of the types of incidents
                        you want to classify. This data then needs to be cleaned and preprocessed, which involves
                        handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies.</li>
                    <li>Feature Engineering: Next, relevant features need to be extracted from the incident
                        descriptions. These features could include keywords, phrases, or numerical values that capture
                        the essential characteristics of the incident.</li>
                    <li>Model Selection: Choosing the appropriate machine learning model depends on the specific
                        characteristics of the data and the classification task. Different models have different
                        strengths and weaknesses, and selecting the optimal one often requires experimentation and
                        evaluation.</li>
                    <li>Model Training: The selected model is then trained using the prepared dataset. This involves
                        feeding the model the incident data and their corresponding classifications, allowing it to
                        learn the patterns and relationships between the features and the categories.</li>
                    <li>Model Evaluation and Refinement: Once the model is trained, it needs to be evaluated on a
                        separate dataset to assess its accuracy and generalizability. The model may need to be refined
                        or retrained based on its performance.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Introducing the Incident Classification Tool</h3>
                <p>To demonstrate the practical application of this process, I've developed an incident classification
                    tool that utilizes machine learning to automate and improve incident classification, which can be
                    accessed at <a href="https://incident-classification-tool.streamlit.app" target="_blank">https://incident-classification-tool.streamlit.app</a>
                </p>

                <p>This tool was trained using a publicly available dataset of OSHA accident and injury data from Kaggle
                    (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruqaiyaship/osha-accident-and-injury-data-1517/data"
                        target="_blank">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruqaiyaship/osha-accident-and-injury-data-1517/data</a>).
                    This dataset contains detailed information about workplace incidents, including the nature of the
                    injury, the part of the body affected, the event type, and the environmental factors involved.</p>

                <h3>How the Tool Works</h3>
                <p>The tool simplifies incident classification into a few key steps:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Data Input: Users input a textual description of the incident.</li>
                    <li>Preprocessing: The tool prepares the text for analysis, removing irrelevant information and
                        extracting key features.</li>
                    <li>Classification: A trained machine learning model analyzes the processed text and predicts the
                        appropriate incident category.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example Scenario</h3>
                <p>To illustrate how this works in practice, imagine an incident report describes an employee's hand being
                    caught in a hydraulic press. The tool would analyze this description, considering factors like the
                    environmental factor (pinch point), the nature of the injury (laceration), the body part affected
                    (hand), and the event type (caught in or between). Based on this analysis, it would classify the
                    incident according to the chosen classification system.</p>

                <h3>The Importance of Data Quality</h3>
                <p>It's important to emphasize that the effectiveness of machine learning relies heavily on the quality of
                    the data it's trained on. Using a dataset that is comprehensive, accurate, consistent, and free of
                    bias is essential for reliable incident analysis and prevention efforts. While the model
                    demonstrates promising results for many variables, it's important to note that accuracy can vary.
                    For some specific variables, the accuracy may be lower, around 40%, indicating that the model may
                    misclassify some incidents in those categories.</p>

                <p>This is partly a result of the public dataset used to train the model, which may have limitations in
                    terms of its size, completeness, and the level of detail in the incident descriptions. This
                    highlights the inherent challenges in accurately classifying complex incident data and the need for
                    continuous improvement and refinement of the model. When using the tool, it's crucial to be aware
                    of these limitations and interpret the results with caution, especially for those variables with
                    lower accuracy.</p>

                <h3>Benefits for Safety Professionals</h3>
                <p>By automating and streamlining the classification process, machine learning can significantly impact
                    the way safety professionals manage and analyze incident data, leading to more efficient workflows
                    and data-driven decision-making. This method offers several key benefits for EHS professionals:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Reduced workload: Automating incident classification frees up time for other critical tasks.</li>
                    <li>Improved accuracy: Machine learning can lead to more accurate and consistent incident
                        classification.</li>
                    <li>Data-driven insights: Accurate classification enables more effective data analysis, leading to
                        proactive safety measures.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>By prioritizing data standardization and harnessing the power of machine learning, we can create safer
                    and healthier workplaces for everyone. This example provides a glimpse into the potential of this
                    technology to transform workplace safety.</p>
