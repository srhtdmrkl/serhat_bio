                <p class="insight-date">November 20, 2025</p>
                <p>In our previous discussions on the <a href="the-ai-readiness-gap-in-ehs.html">AI Readiness Gap</a>
                    and the foundational role of <a
                        href="closing-the-ai-readiness-gap-interoperability-as-the-foundation.html">interoperability</a>,
                    I introduced the concept of raw EHS data as "crude oil"—a substance with immense potential, but one
                    that is messy, unstructured, and unusable in its natural state. An AI cannot learn from data
                    filled with inconsistencies, subjective opinions, and undefined terms.</p>
                <p>Attempting to run an AI on raw data yields "hallucinations"—incorrect predictions that erode trust
                    and waste resources. It won't just fail; it will actively mislead you, identifying risks that don't
                    exist while missing the ones that do.</p>
                <p>The solution is not the software itself, but what you do with your data. Buying AI-enabled software
                    only creates a container; the intelligence comes from the refinement process. This non-negotiable
                    industrial process—The Refinery—is the critical EHS function for transforming raw data into a
                    standardized, usable asset. This refinery process consists of three core components: governance,
                    cleansing, and labeling.</p>

                <h2>1. Data Governance: Digital 5S for Your Database</h2>
                <p>Data governance is a term that causes many leaders to tune out, imagining endless meetings and
                    binders of rules.</p>
                <p>To make this practical, we need to reframe it. Think of governance not as IT bureaucracy, but as
                    Digital 5S. Just as you wouldn't tolerate a cluttered, unsafe shop floor where tools are missing or
                    mislabeled, you cannot tolerate a cluttered, unsafe dataset.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sort:</strong> Identify and deprecate free-text fields in your data collection forms
                        that create ambiguity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Set in Order:</strong> Organize data into a logical EHS Taxonomy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Standardize:</strong> Enforce consistency with mandatory, structured dropdowns.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The core of this Digital 5S approach is building an <strong>EHS Taxonomy</strong>—a rigid
                    classification system designed to eliminate ambiguity. Its entire purpose is to ensure that when two
                    people report the same event, they are forced to use the same language.</p>
                <p>The most effective way to implement this taxonomy is to redesign your data collection forms: remove
                    free-text fields wherever possible and replace them with mandatory, multi-level dropdown menus. This
                    is the practical implementation of a standardized recording framework, a concept I've detailed in my
                    guide to the <a
                        href="a-concise-guide-to-esaw-methodology-for-recording-workplace-accidents.html">ESAW
                        methodology</a>.

                <h3>The Strategic Shift: Separating the Event from the Cause</h3>
                <p>Most legacy EHS reporting systems share the same fundamental flaw: they mix different types of data
                    together. A frontline manager opens the incident form and sees one dropdown containing event types
                    (Injury, Near Miss), severity levels (LTI, MTC, First Aid), and vague root cause categories
                    (Personnel Factors) all jumbled together. This creates ambiguity and forces flawed decisions.</p>

                <h4>The Failure of the Legacy Form:</h4>
                <p>
                    Here's what happens when you mix these categories: the rare, high-consequence events you actually
                    want to predict (like a Laceration) get buried by the hundreds of low-consequence events (like Near
                    Misses). In data science, this is called Class Imbalance, and it breaks AI models. The algorithm
                    will optimize for the most common pattern (Near Miss) and completely ignore the rare but critical
                    signal (LTI). You'll never find the pattern you're looking for. And it gets worse: fields like
                    'Description' and 'Immediate Cause' become unstructured text dumps where people mix <em>what
                        happened</em> (the mechanical event) with <em>why it happened</em> (the systemic cause). The AI
                    gets
                    noise instead of structure.
                </p>

                <h4>The Solution: Implementing a Structured EHS Taxonomy</h4>
                <p>
                    The fix isn't just a prettier form—it's implementing a structured EHS taxonomy based on proven
                    frameworks like ESAW (European), OIICS (North American), or TOOCS (Australian). These frameworks
                    force clarity and objectivity into your data.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Clean Event Separation:</strong> Start by forcing a binary choice: Is this an
                        Injury/Illness or a Near Miss? Once they choose, the form immediately routes them to the
                        appropriate taxonomy. This keeps your high-volume leading indicators (Near Misses) separate from
                        your high-consequence lagging indicators (Injuries), preventing the class imbalance problem that
                        kills AI models.</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Objective Data:</strong> Guide the manager through objective data points
                        defined by the framework. Enforce
                        single-selection rules,
                        keeping your categories clean and mutually exclusive. Here's the key: severity (LTI vs. First
                        Aid)
                        should never be a dropdown choice. Calculate it automatically based on objective fields like
                        'Days
                        Away.' This forces the manager to describe the risk, not just label the result.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Crucial Separation:</strong> Capture the mechanical event in these structured
                        fields,
                        but move root cause analysis to a separate module or another systematic RCA tool. The context
                        isn't lost; it's just moved to where
                        it belongs, in a proper investigation workflow rather than a single text box.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>This structured workflow isn't just better for AI—it's faster and easier for
                    the people filling out the forms. It's a guided process where nobody's guessing anymore. When you
                    build good data governance into your form design, people actually use it. And this separation
                    between what happened and why it happened? That's what unlocks <a
                        href="leveraging-diagnostic-analytics-to-enhance-workplace-safety.html">diagnostic
                        analytics</a>—the difference between simply recording incidents and actually understanding their
                    root causes.</p>

                <h2>2. Data Cleansing: Engineering Your "Data Equity"</h2>

                <p>Governance (Section 1) ensures your future data is clean. But that only stops the bleeding. It does
                    nothing about the massive "Data Debt" (years of poorly structured historical data) sitting in your
                    database right now.</p>

                <p>This is where Data Cleansing comes in. This isn't just about tidying up; it's about engineering
                    equity from your existing data.</p>

                <p>Your historical data is a strategic asset, but right now it's frozen in a state of disrepair.
                    Data cleansing is how you standardize, repair, and curate that data at scale so you can actually
                    use it to train AI models. You can't build a reliable model on a broken foundation.</p>

                <h3>Strategy 1: Standardization (Events, Assets, and Locations)</h3>

                <p>This is your most critical cleansing strategy because it answers two fundamental questions your AI
                    needs to know: <em>what is happening</em> and <em>where is it happening</em>. Without this, your
                    data is just a pile of isolated reports, useless for pattern recognition, and your predictive models
                    will fail.</p>

                <h4>Part A: Standardizing Events (The "What")</h4>
                <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Your database contains "slip," "slipped on wet floor," "fall due to
                    water," and "water hazard." An AI sees these as four different things. Ask it "How many slip/trip
                    hazards did we have?" and it can't answer.</p>
                <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Create a mapping file—a simple two-column spreadsheet. Column A lists
                    the messy terms (e.g., "slipped on wet floor"). Column B has the clean, standardized term from your
                    taxonomy (e.g., "Slip/Trip - Wet Surface"). Hand this to your IT team. They write a find-and-replace
                    script, and what would've been a six-month manual cleanup becomes a ten-minute automated job.</p>

                <h4>Part B: Standardizing Assets & Locations (The "Where")</h4>
                <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> One report says "Line 3," another says "L3-Conveyor," a third says
                    "Conveyor, Line 3." The AI sees three different places and can't connect the dots. This is the
                    biggest barrier to predictive modeling.</p>
                <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Don't build your location list from scratch. This is where your
                    <a href="closing-the-ai-readiness-gap-interoperability-as-the-foundation.html">Interoperability
                        work</a> pays off. Connect to the source of truth: pull the Master Asset List from your CMMS
                    (Maintenance) or the Location Hierarchy from your operations system. Use that as your
                    standardization
                    dictionary.
                </p>

                <p>Example Mapping File:</p>

                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Messy Term</th>
                            <th>Standardized ID</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>"Line 3"</td>
                            <td>L3-CONVEYOR</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>"L3"</td>
                            <td>L3-CONVEYOR</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>"Conveyor, Line 3"</td>
                            <td>L3-CONVEYOR</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>"Line 4"</td>
                            <td>L4-MIXER</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>Once all variations map to the same ID (like `L3-CONVEYOR`), the AI can finally see the complete
                    history of that asset across all your data:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Observation: Unsafe Condition (Guarding) on `L3-CONVEYOR`</li>
                    <li>Near Miss: Object fell from `L3-CONVEYOR`</li>
                    <li>Incident: Hand Laceration on `L3-CONVEYOR`</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Now you've given the AI the context it needs to find patterns. And because both EHS and Maintenance
                    records are standardized to `L3-CONVEYOR`, you can ask high-value questions like: <em>"How many of
                        our 'Guarding' observations on this asset were followed by an 'Overdue PM' work order from the
                        CMMS?"</em> This is how you transform Safety Risk data into Asset Reliability
                    intelligence—proving
                    that EHS data is a leading indicator for maintenance failure and operational risk.
                </p>

                <h3>Strategy 2: Contextual Repair (Handling Missing Data)</h3>

                <p>After standardization, your next challenge is missing data. A single blank field (like a missing
                    'Department' or 'Location') can make an entire report useless for analysis, creating holes that
                    break your models.</p>
                <p>Don't guess at missing data. Repair it using context.</p>
                <p>Remember the <a href="closing-the-ai-readiness-gap-interoperability-as-the-foundation.html">"Common
                        Key" workshop</a> from your interoperability work? This is where it pays off. You don't need to
                    chase down a manager to fill in 'Department' or 'Tenure.' Just pull it from HR using the data bridge
                    you already built. It's a simple query: the system asks the HR bridge "Who is Employee #7781?" and
                    fills in the blanks automatically. This isn't just filling blanks. It's automated data repair that
                    rescues thousands of records from the junk pile.</p>

                <h3>Strategy 3: Feature Selection (Excluding Bad Data)</h3>
                <p>This is the most critical, non-negotiable step in the entire refinery process. While the first two
                    strategies are about improving data, this one is about protecting your models from bad data.</p>
                <p>In data science, this is called Feature Selection. The concept is simple: deliberately exclude toxic,
                    subjective, low-value fields from your analytical datasets.</p>
                <p>A strong model is built on the <em>right</em> data, not the <em>most</em> data. Your job is to
                    exclude the fields that will poison your results.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> Most legacy EHS systems have a mandatory "Root Cause" field with
                        blame-oriented options like "Personnel Factors," "Management System Issues," or "Physical
                        Hazard/Equipment." This isn't data. It's a guess.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Danger:</strong> This isn't a passive problem. It's active sabotage against your AI
                        program. It's the textbook definition of "Bias In, Bias Out." If you feed an AI thousands of
                        reports where
                        "Employee Error" is marked as the cause, you're training it to be a bad safety professional. It
                        will learn
                        your organization's flawed, blame-based logic and predict "operator error" every time, missing
                        the
                        systemic risks you need it to find.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Solution:</strong> Don't delete this data (you may need it for compliance or
                        historical
                        reports). Just quarantine it. Exclude that toxic "Root Cause" field from any analytical dataset
                        you
                        feed to your models. Be ruthless. It's better to build a model on 5 reliable, objective fields
                        (like 'Event Type', 'Location', 'Asset', 'Activity') than to poison it with a 6th field that's
                        fundamentally flawed. This is the test of whether you're serious about data-driven safety or
                        just
                        automating your existing biases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quarantining "Other" Categories:</strong> Another common flaw is the "Other" category.
                        While it seems harmless, "Other" is the digital equivalent of sweeping problems under the rug.
                        If
                        10% of your records fall into "Other," your AI learns to ignore 10% of your unique
                        organizational
                        risk. During cleansing, manually review these records and map them to the most specific category
                        in your taxonomy. Retire the "Other" bucket entirely.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. The 'Data Labeling' Process: Adding Intelligence</h2>
                <p>With your data governed (Section 1) and your historical records cleansed (Section 2), your
                    foundation is solid. Now comes the final step: teaching your AI what to look for.</p>
                <p>This is Data Labeling. It is the process where your EHS experts manually review a sample of
                    unstructured
                    data (like observation notes or inspection descriptions) and tag them with the standardized labels
                    from your taxonomy.</p>
                <p>The goal isn't just to predict accidents—it's to prescribe solutions. An AI that only predicts risk
                    is
                    just a fancy reporting tool. But an AI that learns which corrective actions actually work (and which
                    ones fail) becomes a strategic asset. Data labeling is how you make that leap from prediction to
                    prescription.
                </p>

                <p>Don't focus only on incident reports. Your most valuable unstructured data is probably buried in
                    safety observations, inspections, and risk assessments—your leading indicator data. This typically
                    exists in two fields:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Hazard Description:</strong> What was seen? (e.g., "Guard was off on Line 3
                        conveyor.")</li>
                    <li><strong>The Recommended Action:</strong> What was done about it? (e.g., "Told operator to stop
                        and replace guard," or "Work order submitted to fabricate new guard.")</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You need to train the AI to understand both fields and learn the relationship between them.</p>

                <p>Think of your labeled dataset as a textbook. You're creating a "gold standard" set of examples that
                    shows the AI what to recognize. For instance: "When you see text like 'guard is missing,' classify
                    that as 'Unsafe Condition: Guarding.' And when you see an action like 'install a hard-guard,'
                    classify that as 'Engineering Control.'"</p>


                <h3>The Three Strategic Pillars of the Labeling Process</h3>
                <p>This labeling sprint is the first time your EHS experts and your AI actively collaborate. This is the
                    practical "Human-in-the-Loop" (HITL) process discussed in <a
                        href="closing-the-ai-readiness-gap-interoperability-as-the-foundation.html">Closing the AI
                        Readiness Gap</a>. You're not just tagging rows in a spreadsheet; you're codifying your
                    organization's expertise into a format the machine can learn from.</p>

                <h4>1. Define the Scope and Taxonomies</h4>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Establish the boundary and language for the sprint.</p>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> Assemble 3-5 Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and define a dual taxonomy: one
                    for classifying hazards (e.g., 'Unsafe Condition: Guarding') and another for classifying actions
                    (e.g., 'Engineering Control' from the Hierarchy of Controls). Pull a random sample of 500 to 1,000
                    historical reports. Quality matters more than quantity here.
                </p>

                <h4>2. Execute the Consensus Sprint</h4>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Generate "gold standard" labels for the sample set.</p>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> Have each SME independently label every report in the sample with both a
                    Hazard and an Action classification. The most valuable part remains the disagreements. Bring the
                    experts
                    together to debate classification boundaries like "When an observation says 'operator removed guard
                    to
                    clear jam,' is this primarily a 'Machine Guarding' hazard or a 'Lockout/Tagout' failure?" These
                    debates force your organization to define consistent classification rules. The AI learns from the
                    consensus patterns that emerge.
                </p>

                <h4>3. Finalize the Strategic Asset</h4>

                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Create the deliverable for your technical team.</p>

                <p><strong>Action:</strong> Once consensus is reached, create a three-column spreadsheet: (1) the
                    original observation text, (2) the agreed-upon Hazard Category label, and (3) the Action Category
                    label. This simple file becomes the training data for your Natural Language Processing (NLP) model.
                </p>

                <h3>The Payoff</h3>

                <p>You've now trained an AI to do something valuable: read future observations and classify both the
                    hazards and the actions. But here's the thing. Every EHS professional already knows that engineering
                    controls are better than administrative controls. You don't need AI to tell you that.</p>

                <p>The real value comes from pattern recognition at scale. The AI can prove which actions are failing.
                    For example: "For 'Guarding' hazards, 90% of our actions are administrative controls like signage...
                    and the data shows a 70% repeat-hazard rate at those exact locations within 60 days."</p>

                <p>That's the insight you're after. The AI isn't reciting theory. It's providing a data-driven business
                    case for investing in more effective (and often more expensive) engineering solutions by proving
                    that
                    the cheaper options aren't working.</p>

                <h2>The Refinery Is an EHS Discipline, Not a Project</h2>
                <p>Building your EHS Data Refinery is the most intensive part of becoming AI-ready, but it's also the
                    most valuable.</p>
                <p>This work—governance, cleansing, and labeling—creates value even before you run a
                    single AI algorithm. Clean, standardized data gives you a reliable view of risk in your
                    organization.
                    That alone is worth the effort. It's also the only foundation that reliable predictive models can be
                    built on.</p>
                <p>Don't wait for AI software to arrive before starting this process. You can begin today with Excel and
                    a team of SMEs. The organizations cleaning their data now will be the ones predicting injuries next
                    year.</p>
