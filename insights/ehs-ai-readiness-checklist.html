                        <p><strong>1. When discussing requirements for a new EHS system, how is "AI" typically
                                described?</strong></p>
                        <p><label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="1"> (1 Point) As a single line-item in a list of
                                features, like "Add AI for intelligent suggestions," with the expectation that the
                                vendor will figure it out.</label><br>
                            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="2"> (2 Points) As a high-level goal, such as "We
                                want to use AI to predict risks," but without a detailed scope for the data or R&D
                                effort required.</label><br>
                            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="3"> (3 Points) As a distinct strategic
                                initiative, with dedicated discussions about specific use cases, data requirements,
                                necessary expertise, and long-term goals.</label><br>

                        <p><label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="1"> (1 Point) We expect it to work "out of the box"
                            to automatically find root causes or predict incidents with minimal human oversight, much
                            like a magic wand.</label><br>
                        <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="2"> (2 Points) We expect it to improve efficiency by
                            automating existing tasks, such as classifying incident reports or identifying trends from
                            dashboard data.</label><br>

                            capability that evolves. We plan to start with a specific, well-defined problem and
                            understand it will require ongoing investment and refinement to deliver strategic

                            inclusive part of the overall EHS software license fee.</label><br>
                        <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="2"> (2 Points) We've allocated a budget for an "AI
                            module" from a software vendor, but have not yet budgeted for the internal resources needed
                            for data preparation, validation, and training.</label><br>
                        <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="3"> (3 Points) We recognize it as an R&D-level
                            investment and have a dedicated budget that accounts for both the technology and the
                            involvement of our internal subject matter experts.</label><br></p>

                    <h2>Section B: Data Maturity</h2>
                    <p>This section evaluates the quality, consistency, and governance of your EHS data.</p>

                    <div class="question">
                        <p><strong>4. How would you describe your organization's historical EHS incident data?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p><label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="1"> (1 Point) It is decentralized in various
                            spreadsheets, Word documents, or legacy systems with inconsistent formats and terminology.
                            It's essentially "crude oil."</label><br>
                        <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="2"> (2 Points) We use a central system, but data
                            entry practices are inconsistent across different sites or business units. The same term
                            (e.g., "Lost Time Incident") can have different meanings.</label><br>
                        <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="3"> (3 Points) We have a formal data governance
                            policy. Data is captured in a structured, centralized system with clear, enforced
                            definitions and is subject to regular quality audits.</label><br></p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="question">
                        <p><strong>5. How are subjective EHS assessments (e.g., risk severity, likelihood) handled
                                across your organization?</strong></p>
                        <p><label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="1"> (1 Point) They are based purely on the
                            discretion of individual managers, resulting in significant variation from one report to the
                            next.</label><br>
                        <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="2"> (2 Points) We provide general guidelines and
                            training on how to use our risk matrix, but we lack a systematic process to ensure it's
                            applied consistently.</label><br>
                        <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="3"> (3 Points) We use a standardized, calibrated
                            methodology (e.g., a detailed risk matrix with explicit criteria for each level) that is
                            enforced and audited to ensure consistency.</label><br></p>

                    <div class="question">
                        <p><strong>6. If you were asked to provide a "clean" and "labeled" dataset for an AI
                                proof-of-concept today, what would that process look like?</strong></p>
                        <p><label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="1"> (1 Point) It would require a massive, manual
                            effort to find, consolidate, and attempt to standardize data from scratch. We wouldn't be
                            confident in the output.</label><br>
                        <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="2"> (2 Points) We could export data from our central
                            system, but it would need significant manual cleaning, re-formatting, and interpretation by
                            an expert before it would be usable.</label><br>
                        <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="3"> (3 Points) We have established data pipelines
                            and clear governance. We could generate a structured, reliable dataset for a specific use
                            case (e.g., all near-misses from the last 3 years) with relative ease.</label><br></p>

                    <div class="question">
                        <p><strong>7. How integrated is your EHS data with other critical business systems (e.g., HR,
                                Maintenance, Operations)?</strong></p>
                        <p><label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="1"> (1 Point) Completely siloed. Our EHS data lives
                            in its own system (or spreadsheets) and has no connection to other departmental
                            data.</label><br>
                        <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="2"> (2 Points) Manual integration. We manually
                            export and combine data from different systems when needed for analysis.</label><br>
                        <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="3"> (3 Points) Strategic integration. Our EHS system
                            talks to HR, Operations, and Maintenance systems (via APIs or a data warehouse), giving us a
                            holistic view of risk.</label><br></p>

                    <div class="question">
                        <p><strong>8. How does your organization typically approach the procurement of a major software
                                system like an EHS platform?</strong></p>
                        <p><label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="1"> (1 Point) We issue a detailed Request for
                            Proposal (RFP) with a fixed scope, timeline, and budget, expecting a fully "finished"
                            product on a specific delivery date.</label><br>
                        <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="2"> (2 Points) We use a traditional project-based

                        <p><label><input type="radio" name="q11" value="1"> (1 Point) Punitive. Incidents (especially
                            near-misses) are often under-reported or hidden to avoid "getting in trouble." We don't have
                            honest data to feed an AI.</label><br>
                        <label><input type="radio" name="q11" value="2"> (2 Points) Neutral/Reactive. Reporting is
                            encouraged, but employees are skeptical that management might use the data against them.
                            Data quality is questionable.</label><br>
