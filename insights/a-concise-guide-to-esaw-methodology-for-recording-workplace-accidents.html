                <p>Recording and reporting workplace accidents accurately and promptly are essential elements of a
                    robust
                    occupational health and safety management system. This process goes beyond legal compliance, serving
                    as a cornerstone for protecting employee well-being, fostering a proactive safety culture, and
                    driving ongoing improvement across the organization.</p>

                <h3>What is ESAW</h3>
                <p>The European Statistics on Accidents at Work (ESAW) project, initiated in 1990, stems from the
                    Framework Directive 89/391/EEC, which establishes guidelines to improve health and safety of
                    employees. This directive obligates employers to maintain records of workplace accidents that lead
                    to employee incapacity and to generate reports on these incidents, in line with national laws and
                    practices. You can find the official publication of the methodology on the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-manuals-and-guidelines/-/ks-ra-12-015" target="_blank">Eurostat website</a>.</p>
                <p>ESAW is an effort to standardize workplace accident data across Europe. This harmonized approach
                    enables a thorough analysis of occupational health and safety performance by providing consistent,
                    comparable data across countries. By establishing a uniform methodology for recording and reporting
                    accidents at work, ESAW facilitates the collection of high-quality data that supports informed
                    decision-making and the development of tailored occupational health and safety interventions.</p>

                <h3>How the ESAW Methodology Standardizes Accident Records</h3>
                <p>The ESAW methodology provides a structured framework for recording and classifying workplace
                    accidents,
                    ensuring that data is consistent and comparable across organizations and nations.</p>

                <h4>Common Definitions</h4>
                <p>ESAW defines essential terms and concepts, clarifying what qualifies as a workplace accident. By
                    establishing uniform definitions, ESAW minimizes ambiguity in data interpretation, leading to more
                    accurate reporting and analysis.</p>

                <h4>Standardized Classifications</h4>
                <p>ESAW introduces standardized classifications for various aspects of accidents, including the events
                    and
                    materials involved, types and severity of injuries, and other relevant factors. These
                    classifications support consistent categorization, making it possible to conduct meaningful analyses
                    and report findings effectively at both national and European levels.</p>

                <h4>Reporting Criteria</h4>
                <p>The methodology outlines specific criteria for reporting workplace accidents, guiding organizations
                    in
                    collecting essential information in a consistent and standardized format.</p>

                <h3>Key Concepts in ESAW Methodology</h3>
                <h4>Definition of a Workplace Accident</h4>
                <p>To standardize the recording and reporting of workplace accidents, ESAW provides a clear definition:
                    an accident at work is defined as “a discrete occurrence in the course of work which leads to
                    physical or mental harm.” This definition serves as the foundation for consistent data collection
                    across organizations and jurisdictions.</p>

                <h4>Types of Injuries Included in ESAAW Reporting</h4>

                <h5>Included Cases:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Acute Poisoning: Instances where employees experience poisoning from exposure to hazardous
                        substances during work.</li>
                    <li>Wilful Acts by Others: Injuries intentionally caused by another individual.</li>
                    <li>Accidents at Another Employer’s Premises: Injuries sustained while an employee is conducting
                        business at another location, such as attending meetings, providing services, or performing
                        work-related tasks. This may include off-site meetings, deliveries, repairs, and client site
                        activities.</li>
                    <li>Accidents in Public Spaces or on Public Transport: This covers road traffic accidents occurring
                        during work-related travel on public roads or business premises. It applies particularly to
                        occupations with regular travel on public roads, such as drivers and field service personnel.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Excluded Cases:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Commuting Accidents: Injuries sustained during the routine journey between home and the
                        workplace.</li>
                    <li>Self-Inflicted Injuries: Injuries that are deliberately self-inflicted by the individual.</li>
                    <li>Accidents Due to Natural Causes: Injuries resulting solely from medical conditions (e.g., a
                        cardiac incident) without any work-related contributing factors.</li>
                    <li>Private Accidents: Injuries that occur during non-work-related activities and offsite.</li>
                    <li>Injuries to Members of the Public: This includes accidents involving non-employees, such as
                        family members, even if they are present on business premises.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Key Variables for Describing an Accident</h4>
                <p>To ensure thorough and consistent accident records, ESAW defines specific variables to describe
                    essential details about the accident:</p>

                <h5>Location, Victim, and Time:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Economic activity of the employer using the NACE Rev.2 classification</li>
                    <li>Occupation (ISCO-08), employment status (ISCE-93), age, gender, and nationality of the injured
                        person</li>
                    <li>Business size and location of the accident site</li>
                    <li>Date and time of the accident</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Consequences:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Type of Injury</li>
                    <li>Body Part Injured</li>
                    <li>Days Lost (Severity of injury)</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Circumstances and Causes:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Working environment and setting</li>
                    <li>General activity the employee was performing</li>
                    <li>Specific activity immediately preceding the accident and any related material agents</li>
                    <li>Deviation or event leading to the accident and associated material agents</li>
                    <li>Contact and mode of injury with relevant material agents involved in the injury</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Recording and Reporting of Accident Data</h3>
                <p>Accurate and comprehensive recording of accident data is crucial for maintaining a safe work
                    environment. The variables outlined in the ESAW methodology provide essential insights into the
                    accident, the injured person, and the employer, enabling meaningful analysis and preventive
                    measures.</p>

                <h4>Type of Injury</h4>
                <p>The "Type of Injury" code describes the physical consequences of the injury sustained by the
                    individual. When multiple injuries occur, the code for the most severe injury should generally be
                    used. However, if injuries of equal severity are present, the code "Multiple Injuries (120)" is
                    selected to reflect this.</p>

                <p>The main categories of injury types include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wounds and Superficial Injuries: This category includes surface injuries like foreign bodies
                        entering the eye or ear, non-venomous insect bites, and nail loss.</li>
                    <li>Bone Fractures: Encompasses all types of fractures.</li>
                    <li>Dislocations, Sprains, and Strains: Covers acute musculoskeletal injuries due to over-straining
                        muscles, tendons, ligaments, and joints.</li>
                    <li>Traumatic Loss of an Organ or Body Part: This includes amputations, crush injuries, and
                        enucleations (e.g., traumatic eye avulsions, loss of ear tissue).</li>
                    <li>Concussion and Internal Injuries: Encompasses all internal injuries not classified as fractures.
                    </li>
                    <li>Burns, Scalds, and Frostbite: This category includes burns from ingestion of caustic or
                        corrosive
                        substances and frostbite, but excludes hypothermia.</li>
                    <li>Poisoning and Infections: Excludes cases of anaphylactic shock.</li>
                    <li>Drowning and Suffocation: Excludes asphyxiation from toxic gases such as carbon monoxide.</li>
                    <li>Effects of Sound, Vibration, and Pressure: Covers injuries due to exposure to high sound levels,
                        intense vibrations, or pressure changes.</li>
                    <li>Effects of Extreme Heat, Light, and Radiation: Includes injuries from high temperatures and
                        radiation exposure but excludes sunburn and frostbite.</li>
                    <li>Shock: Encompasses traumatic shocks, such as electric shocks, lightning strikes, or delayed
                        shock
                        following injury, and includes non-physical trauma from animal attacks, natural disasters, and
                        similar events.</li>
                    <li>Multiple Injuries: Used only when two or more injuries of equal severity are present.</li>
                    <li>Injuries Not Classified Under Other Headings: This group is a catch-all for injuries not covered
                        by other categories, such as nerve and spinal cord injuries, blood vessel injuries, and foreign
                        bodies entering natural orifices.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Part of Body Injured</h4>
                <p>This variable identifies the specific body part affected by the injury. Only one code is selected to
                    represent the injured body part, even in cases involving multiple injuries. If several body parts
                    are affected, the code should reflect the most severe injury (e.g., an amputation would take
                    precedence over a fracture). For injuries affecting larger areas, such as burns, the code “Multiple
                    sites of the body affected (78)” is recommended to accurately represent the extent of the injury.
                </p>

                <p>Recording the specific body part injured in workplace accidents is crucial for identifying patterns
                    and assessing risk exposure, as certain tasks or environments may pose a higher threat to specific
                    body parts. This detailed information enables organizations to pinpoint where injuries frequently
                    occur, helping them tailor interventions to protect vulnerable areas. For instance, if hand injuries
                    are consistently reported, this might indicate the need for improved hand protection, such as gloves
                    with better grip or cut-resistant materials, or increased safety measures in tasks involving
                    machinery or sharp tools.</p>

                <h4>Days Lost (Severity)</h4>
                <p>The severity of a workplace accident is measured by the total number of full calendar days during
                    which the injured person is unable to work. Only full days where no work was performed are counted,
                    with the day of the accident itself excluded. This calculation includes weekends, public holidays,
                    and other days that the injured individual would typically not work, whether they are part-time or
                    full-time employees.</p>

                <p>Accurately recording lost days is essential not only for meeting regulatory requirements but also for
                    calculating key performance indicators such as accident severity rates. These metrics provide
                    insights into the impact of accidents on the workforce and help organizations assess the
                    effectiveness of their safety measures.</p>

                <p>ESAW also uses specific codes to indicate permanent incapacity and fatal accidents. In these cases,
                    only the days lost prior to the diagnosis of permanent incapacity or death are included in the lost
                    days calculation.</p>

                <h4>Workstation</h4>
                <p>The "Workstation" variable identifies the specific setting where the injured person was performing
                    their task at the time of the accident. It distinguishes between a usual workstation, where the
                    individual typically works, and an occasional or mobile workstation, where the employee may work
                    less frequently. This information is valuable for understanding the context of the accident, as the
                    nature of the workstation often influences the risk factors and conditions associated with the
                    event.</p>

                <h4>Working Environment</h4>
                <p>The "Working Environment" variable describes the specific workplace, work premises, or general
                    environment where an accident took place. Each code corresponds to a distinct work setting,
                    allowing for accurate categorization and analysis of accidents based on the environment in which
                    they occur.</p>

                <p>Differentiating between environments is key. For example, while a classroom in a school and a
                    training
                    room in a factory may have similar purposes, they fall under distinct environment codes. Similarly,
                    tasks performed at a shipyard versus on a ship at sea require separate codes due to the unique
                    conditions of each setting.</p>

                <p>When coding the work environment, focus on the physical setting rather than the specific activity
                    being performed, with the exception of construction sites. For instance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Non-Construction Activities: If an employee is changing light bulbs in a school corridor, the
                        environment should be coded as "Teaching establishment, school, secondary school, college,
                        university, crèche, day nursery (042)." However, a staircase in a factory would be coded as
                        "Production area, factory, workshop (011)."</li>
                    <li>Construction Activities: For any construction-related work within an environment, such as
                        painting, electrical work, or renovations at a school, the environment should be coded as
                        "Construction site - building being constructed (021)."</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Additionally, shared spaces - like entrances, corridors, staircases, and extensions - are considered
                    integral parts of the same environment. For example, a hospital corridor is coded as "Health
                    establishment, private hospital, hospital, nursing home (051)," while a factory stairwell remains
                    part of the "Production area, factory, workshop (011)" environment.</p>

                <h4>Working Process</h4>
                <p>The "Working Process" variable categorizes the general activity or task the injured person was
                    performing at the time of the accident. This variable reflects the broader work process, rather
                    than the specific action being performed in the accident’s moment.</p>

                <p>For example, if an employee is injured while walking to the cafeteria during a lunch break, this
                    activity would be coded as “Movement (61)”. Conversely, if a cleaner sprains their wrist while
                    moving between offices, the working process would be coded as “Cleaning working areas (53)”.</p>

                <p>Construction work often falls under the broader category of "Excavation, construction, repair,
                    demolition (20)," but individual activities are coded based on their nature:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preparing a construction site: “Setting up, preparation, installation, mounting, disassembling,
                        dismantling (51)”</li>
                    <li>Excavation or leveling work: “Excavation (21)”</li>
                    <li>Crane installation: “Setting up, preparation, installation, mounting, disassembling, dismantling
                        (51)”</li>
                    <li>On-site crane maintenance or repairs: “Maintenance, repair, tuning, adjustment (52)”</li>
                    <li>Site cleanup after construction: “Cleaning working areas (53)”</li>
                    <li>Waste loading and disposal: “Waste management, disposal, waste treatment of all kinds (54)”</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Specific Physical Activity</h4>
                <p>The "Specific Physical Activity" variable identifies the precise action the injured person was
                    performing at the moment of the accident. This activity is distinct from both the broader working
                    process and the person's occupation, focusing instead on the intentional action immediately
                    preceding the accident.</p>

                <p>To clarify, let’s revisit two examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example 1: A cleaning worker sprains their wrist while walking between offices as part of a
                        cleaning task. Here, the specific activity at the time of accident would be coded as “Walking,
                        running, going up, going down, etc. (61)"</li>
                    <li>Example 2: If a worker who has spent the afternoon cleaning a machine sustains an injury while
                        entering the cafeteria for lunch, the specific activity would also be movement-related, such as
                        "Getting in or out (62)."</li>
                </ul>

                <p>However, if the same worker was injured while cleaning with a hand tool, the specific activity would
                    fall under "Working with hand-held tools (20)."</p>

                <p>When tools or materials are used outside of their intended purpose, this distinction should be
                    reflected
                    in the coding. For example, if a flat chisel is used in different ways, each scenario would have
                    its own code:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using the chisel as a hand tool: "Working with hand-held tools - manual (21)"</li>
                    <li>Throwing the chisel: "Throwing, flinging away (44)"</li>
                    <li>Using the chisel to open a bottle: "Opening, closing (box, package, parcel) (45)"</li>
                    <li>Holding the chisel without specific use: "Manually taking hold of, grasping, seizing, holding,
                        placing (41)"</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Similarly, consider the different codes for tasks involved in changing a vehicle tire:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Holding the tire before removal: "Manually taking hold of, grasping, seizing, holding, placing
                        (41)"</li>
                    <li>Removing and lowering the tire: "Carrying vertically - lifting, raising, lowering an object
                        (51)"
                    </li>
                    <li>Raising a spare tire to install: "Carrying vertically - lifting, raising, lowering an object
                        (51)"
                    </li>
                    <li>Placing the tire: "Fastening, hanging up, raising, putting up - on a vertical level (43)"</li>
                </ul>

                <p>By using these specific activity codes, organizations can capture a detailed picture of the accident
                    circumstances, supporting accurate data collection and meaningful accident analysis.</p>

                <h4>Deviation</h4>
                <p>"Deviation" refers to the unexpected event or series of events that disrupt the normal course of an
                    activity, ultimately causing an accident. In cases where multiple events lead to an injury, only
                    the last deviation (the one closest to the actual contact causing injury) is recorded.</p>

                <p>For example, consider a laboratory technician handling a glass bottle of corrosive solution:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The technician drops the bottle.</li>
                    <li>The bottle breaks.</li>
                    <li>The solution splashes onto the technician.</li>
                    <li>The solution causes burns upon contact.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In this scenario, there are three deviations: “Loss of control (total or partial) (42)”, “Breakage,
                    bursting - causing splinters (32)”, and “Liquid state – leaking, oozing, flowing, splashing,
                    spraying (22)”. However, the last deviation is recorded, as it is closest to the injury-causing
                    event.</p>

                <p>The ESAW methodology organizes deviation codes to reflect the type and sequence of events leading to
                    accidents:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>10-19: Deviations due to electrical failures, static electricity, explosions, or fires.</li>
                    <li>20-29: Unexpected appearance or contact with gasses, liquids, vapors, or dust.</li>
                    <li>30-39: Events outside the injured person's control, such as breakage or collapse.</li>
                    <li>40-49: Loss of control of a material agent by the injured person or another individual. This may
                        include total or partial loss of control.</li>
                    <li>50-59: Slips, trips, and falls. This range differentiates between falls at the same level and
                        those from a height.</li>
                    <li>60-69 and 70-79: Injuries from body movements. The 60-69 range generally covers injuries without
                        physical strain, while 70-79 covers incidents involving significant exertion, often resulting
                        in internal injuries.</li>
                    <li>80-89: Physical violence or traumatic events.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Examples of Deviation Codes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Breakage of a ladder step: "Breakage of material - at joint, at seams (31)"</li>
                    <li>Furniture tipping over onto the injured person: "Slip, fall, collapse of material agent - on the
                        same level (35)"</li>
                    <li>A handheld or carried item tipping over: "Loss of control (total or partial) – of objects (being
                        carried, moved, handled, etc.) (44)"</li>
                    <li>Falling from a chair, ladder, or scaffold to a lower level: "Fall of person – to a lower level
                        (51)"</li>
                    <li>Slipping, tripping, or falling while walking: "Slipping – stumbling and falling – fall of of
                        person – on the same level (52)"</li>
                    <li>Musculoskeletal injury while pushing or pulling a load: "Pushing, pulling (72)"</li>
                    <li>Tripping without falling: "Treading badly, twisting leg or ankle, slipping without falling (75)"
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Contact and Mode of Injury</h4>
                <p>The "Contact and Mode of Injury" code describes how the injured person sustained the injury,
                    specifically identifying the mode of contact with the object or substance causing harm. Examples
                    include striking a surface, making contact with a sharp object, or being exposed to hazardous
                    substances. To ensure precision, only the event that led to the most severe injury should be
                    recorded.</p>

                <p>The ESAW methodology categorizes these injury contacts within specific code ranges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>10-19: Injuries caused by exposure to electrical voltage, temperature, or hazardous substances.
                        This range includes burns, shocks, and chemical exposures.</li>
                    <li>20-29: Events leading to suffocation or asphyxiation due to oxygen deficiency.</li>
                    <li>31-39: Situations where the injured person is in motion and contacts a stationary object. For
                        example, "Vertical motion, crash on or against (resulting from fall)" applies when an injury
                        results from falling and hitting a fixed object.</li>
                    <li>40-49: Instances where the object causing the injury is in motion, potentially colliding with or
                        striking the injured person.</li>
                    <li>50-59: Injuries involving cuts, punctures, scratches, or abrasions from sharp, pointed, rough,
                        or
                        coarse material agents.</li>
                    <li>60-69: Crushing injuries that occur when the injured person is trapped between or under objects.
                        These incidents typically involve forceful contact due to the object's size, weight, pressure,
                        or speed.</li>
                    <li>70-79: Injuries resulting from physical or mental stress.</li>
                    <li>80-89: Injuries involving bites, stings, or aggressive contacts.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Examples of Contact and Mode of Injury Codes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Touching live wires resulting in electric shock: "Direct contact with electricity, receipt of
                        electrical charge in the body (12)"</li>
                    <li>Breathing in toxic fumes leading to asphyxiation: "Enveloped in, surrounded by gas or airborne
                        particles (23)"</li>
                    <li>Falling and hitting a surface (e.g., ground or floor): "Vertical motion, crash on or against
                        (resulting from a fall) (31)"</li>
                    <li>Struck by a moving vehicle or equipment: "Collision with an object, including vehicles -
                        collision
                        with a person (the victim is moving) (45)"</li>
                    <li>Cut by a knife while working: "Contact with a sharp material agent (knife, blade etc.) (51)"
                    </li>
                    <li>Crushed between two heavy objects: "Trapped, crushed - between (62)"</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Material Agent</h4>
                <p>"Material agents" refer to the objects, tools, or equipment associated with the specific activity,
                    deviation, or mode of injury. These agents play a critical role in identifying the elements involved
                    in the accident, providing valuable context for analysis and preventive action.</p>

                <h5>Types of Material Agents:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Material Agent Related to Specific Activity: This is the tool, object, or device the injured
                        person was using when the accident occurred. If multiple agents were involved, record the one
                        most closely connected to the activity or injury.</li>
                    <li>Material Agent Related to Deviation: This refers to the tool, object, or device that caused the
                        activity to deviate from its normal course, leading to the accident. In cases of multiple
                        agents, select the one most directly associated with the deviation event.</li>
                    <li>Material Agent Related to Mode of Injury: This is the object, tool, device, or natural element
                        with which the injured person came into direct contact, causing the injury. If several agents
                        are involved, choose the one that caused the most serious injury.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>All three types of material agents are recorded from the same list. In some cases, the same agent may
                    apply to all categories, while in others, they may differ or be absent altogether.</p>

                <h5>Material Agent Code Groups:</h5>

                    <li>99.00 : Other material agents</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Codes 01 to 03 are primarily used when the injured person falls on or collides with a surface.</p>

                <p>Codes 04 to 11 are applicable for accidents involving machinery or tools, including those caused by
                    equipment malfunctions.</p>

                <p>Codes 12 and 13 apply to transportation vehicles; however, civil engineering and agricultural devices
                    are coded under codes 09.</p>
