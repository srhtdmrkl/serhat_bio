                <img src="../images/leveraging-diagnostic-analysis.webp" alt="An illustration of a magnifying glass over a bar chart, symbolizing the use of diagnostic analytics to investigate workplace safety data." class="insight-image" width="800" height="450">
                <p>In our previous discussion, we explored the <a href="a-concise-guide-to-esaw-methodology-for-recording-workplace-accidents.html">European Statistics on Accidents at Work (ESAW) methodology</a>, highlighting its role in standardizing the recording of workplace accidents. By
                    providing a structured framework, ESAW ensures that data on workplace incidents is consistent and
                    comparable, serving as a solid foundation for analyzing occupational health and safety performance
                    across organizations and nations.</p>

                <p>Building on that foundation, we now turn our attention to the next step: transforming recorded data
                    into actionable insights through diagnostic analytics. This analytical approach goes beyond merely
                    documenting incidents: it seeks to understand the underlying reasons why accidents occur, enabling
                    organizations to implement effective preventive measures and foster a proactive safety culture.</p>

                <h3>Diagnostic Analytics</h3>
                <p>Diagnostic analytics involves examining historical data to uncover patterns, relationships, and root
                    causes of events. In the context of Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS), it means analyzing
                    records to identify the factors contributing to workplace incidents.</p>

                <p>This approach allows organizations to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify trends and patterns: Recognize recurring issues that may not be immediately apparent.
                    </li>
                    <li>Uncover root causes: Determine the fundamental issues leading to safety incidents.</li>
                    <li>Inform decision-making: Provide data-driven insights to guide corrective actions and preventive
                        measures.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Importance of Analysis</h3>
                <p>While accurate recording of accidents is essential for compliance and documentation, analysis of this
                    data is crucial. It's this analysis that truly drives safety improvements. Recording tells us
                    ‘what’ happened; diagnostic analytics helps us understand ‘why’ it happened.</p>

                <p>For instance, an organization might notice an increase in slips, trips, and falls incidents. Without
                    analysis, the response might be limited to general reminders about caution. However, diagnostic
                    analytics could reveal that these incidents predominantly occur in a specific area due to a leaking
                    pipe, leading to targeted maintenance and preventing future accidents. Similarly, an uptick in eye
                    injuries might seem like a random occurrence. But through analysis, it could be discovered that
                    these incidents are concentrated among workers operating a particular machine with inadequate eye
                    protection. This insight would prompt a review of safety protocols for that machine, potentially
                    leading to the implementation of engineering controls or the provision of more suitable personal
                    protective equipment.</p>

                <p>Ultimately, diagnostic analytics allows organizations to move beyond reactive measures and address
                    the
                    underlying causes of accidents, creating a safer work environment.</p>

                <h3>Case Study: Diagnosing a Surge in Workplace Accidents</h3>
                <p>A chemical manufacturing company has observed a troubling trend: over the past six months, there has
                    been a significant increase in workplace accidents. This surge not only raises serious concerns
                    about employee safety but also poses potential regulatory compliance issues. The Environment,
                    Health, and Safety (EHS) team is tasked with investigating the underlying causes of this increase
                    and developing effective corrective actions. Fortunately, all accident data has been carefully
                    recorded using the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/health/health-safety-work/methodology" target="_blank">European Statistics on Accidents at Work (ESAW) methodology</a>.</p>

                <h4>Data Collection and Preparation</h4>
                <p>The EHS team begins by compiling all accident reports from the past six months, ensuring that each
                    incident is accurately coded. This comprehensive data includes variables such as the type of injury,
                    the part of the body injured, days lost (indicating severity), working process, specific physical
                    activity, deviation, contact and mode of injury, and material agents involved.</p>

                <p>In addition to the ESAW-coded data, the team collects supplementary information to enrich their
                    analysis. This includes training records, data on work schedules (including shift patterns and
                    overtime hours), equipment logs detailing maintenance records and any reports of malfunctions, and
                    environmental conditions such as temperature, ventilation, and exposure levels.</p>

                <h4>Analyzing the Data</h4>
                <p>With the data carefully prepared, the EHS team dives into the analysis, employing a combination of
                    techniques to identify patterns and trends. They sort and filter the data, generating summary
                    statistics and creating initial visualizations. Recognizing the complexity of the data and the need
                    to understand the factors influencing safety incidents, they model the relationships between
                    variables such as employee training, equipment age, and workplace conditions against recorded
                    incidents. This deeper dive allows them to pinpoint the most significant contributors to risk and
                    prioritize areas for improvement.</p>

                <h4>Exploratory Data Analysis</h4>
                <p>The initial exploratory data analysis reveals several patterns:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Injury Types: A bar chart of injury frequency clearly shows a high incidence of chemical burns
                        (062 - Chemical burns - corrosions). These burns predominantly affect the upper extremities of
                        employees, with a focus on the hands (53 - Hand).</li>
                    <li>Shift-Based Analysis: A pie chart comparing accidents across shifts highlights a
                        disproportionate
                        number occurring during the night shift. This raises questions about the potential impact of
                        fatigue and reduced supervision during these hours.</li>
                    <li>Experience Level: A scatter plot of years of experience against the number of accidents shows a
                        clear trend: newer employees, especially those with less than one year of service, are more
                        frequently involved in incidents.</li>
                    <li>Equipment and Location: A heat map visualizing accident locations within the facility reveals
                        clusters of incidents in specific areas. Further investigation shows these areas are
                        characterized by poor ventilation and higher temperatures. Additionally, analysis of the
                        "Equipment ID" variable shows that certain machines and tools are repeatedly associated with
                        accidents.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Correlations and Cross-Referencing</h4>
                <p>Moving beyond basic trends, the team employs statistical methods to uncover deeper correlations:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Training Deficiencies: Cross-referencing incident records with employee training records reveals
                        a significant finding: many employees involved in accidents have incomplete safety training
                        records, particularly those related to specific equipment operation and chemical handling.</li>
                    <li>Maintenance Gaps: Analyzing the "Last Maintenance Date" variable for equipment involved in
                        accidents shows a concerning pattern: a significant proportion of these machines and tools have
                        overdue maintenance or show a history of reported malfunctions.</li>
                    <li>Shift Fatigue: To investigate the spike in night shift accidents, the team analyzes overtime
                        hours and conducts surveys to gauge fatigue levels. The data confirms that night shift workers
                        report higher levels of fatigue and express concerns about lower levels of supervision compared
                        to day shifts.</li>
                    <li>Deviation and Activity Analysis: By analyzing the correlation between ESAW deviation codes and
                        specific physical activities, the team identifies high-risk combinations. For instance, they
                        might find that loss of control (41 - Loss of control (total or partial) - of machine or of the
                        material being worked by the machine) is particularly prevalent during operation of machinery
                        (10 - Operating machine), suggesting a need for improved machine guarding or operational
                        procedures.</li>
                    <li>Clustering: Using clustering algorithms, the team identifies groups of similar accidents based
                        on
                        common variables. For example, they might find a cluster of accidents involving specific
                        deviation (22 - Liquid state - leaking, oozing, flowing, splashing, spraying), contact-mode of
                        injury (16 - Contact with hazardous substances - on/through skin or eyes), and material agent
                        (15.01 Substances – caustic, corrosive) occurring among newer employees during the night shift
                        in poorly ventilated areas. This points to a specific area needing immediate attention.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Now, the EHS team gains a much richer understanding of the factors contributing to the surge in
                    accidents. This detailed analysis allows them to move beyond immediate observations and formulate
                    targeted hypotheses about the root causes.</p>

                <h4>Uncovering Root Causes</h4>
                <p>The analysis, using various charts, graphs, and statistical tests, allows the EHS team to identify
                    the
                    root causes of the accidents.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Deviations: The prevalence of loss of control of machinery (41 - Loss of control (total or
                        partial) - of machine or of the material being worked by the machine) suggests issues with
                        equipment malfunction, inadequate training on machine operation, or potentially rushing due to
                        production pressures. Drilling down further, they find that a significant portion of these
                        incidents involve older models of their mixing machines (identified by their Equipment IDs),
                        known to have sensitive controls.</li>
                    <li>Chemical Spill Investigation: The increase in incidents with specific deviation (22 - Liquid
                        state - leaking, oozing, flowing, splashing, spraying) raises concerns about chemical handling
                        procedures. A closer look reveals that many of these incidents involve newer employees working
                        the night shift, often in areas with poor ventilation where fumes might be more concentrated,
                        leading to disorientation or impaired judgment.</li>
                    <li>The Human Factor: The recurring theme of inexperience and training gaps underscores the
                        importance of human factors. It's likely the onboarding process is rushed, or the training
                        materials are outdated and don't adequately cover the hazards of the newer chemicals.</li>
                    <li>Environmental Stressors: The correlation between high-temperature areas, poor ventilation, and
                        accident frequency points to a clear environmental contribution. Employees working in these
                        conditions might be experiencing heat stress, fatigue, and reduced concentration, making them
                        more prone to errors.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Formulating Hypotheses</h4>
                <p>Based on these insights, the team formulates more specific and actionable hypotheses:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Hypothesis 1: Equipment Failure: Aging mixing machines with sensitive controls are more prone to
                        malfunctions, leading to "loss of control" incidents. Insufficient maintenance and a lack of
                        readily available spare parts exacerbate the problem.</li>
                    <li>Hypothesis 2: Training Deficiency: New employees are not receiving adequate hands-on training
                        for
                        operating mixing machines and handling the newer chemicals, particularly in challenging
                        environmental conditions.</li>
                    <li>Hypothesis 3: Environmental Hazards: High temperatures and poor ventilation in certain areas of
                        the facility contribute to fatigue, heat stress, and reduced alertness, increasing the risk of
                        both equipment-related incidents and chemical spills.</li>
                    <li>Hypothesis 4: Procedural Gaps: There may be inadequate procedures for responding to small
                        chemical
                        spills or leaks, particularly during the night shift when supervision is limited.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Validating Hypotheses</h4>
                <p>To validate these hypotheses, the team gathers further evidence:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Employee Interviews: They conduct interviews with employees involved in recent accidents, as
                        well
                        as those working in the high-risk areas. These interviews reveal concerns about equipment
                        reliability, uncertainty about specific chemical handling procedures, and dissatisfaction with
                        the ventilation system in certain areas.</li>
                    <li>Supervisor Input: Supervisors provide valuable insights into equipment performance, employee
                        behavior, and potential training gaps. They confirm the challenges with maintaining the older
                        mixing machines and express concerns about the level of support provided to new employees on the
                        night shift.</li>
                    <li>Maintenance Log: A detailed review of maintenance logs confirms that the older mixing machines
                        have a history of issues and often experience delays in repairs due to a lack of spare parts.
                    </li>
                    <li>Training Record: Analysis of training records not only confirms that many employees involved in
                        accidents lack required safety modules but also reveals inconsistencies in training quality and
                        a lack of refresher courses.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>By combining data analysis with qualitative information gathered through interviews and record
                    reviews,
                    the EHS team builds a strong case for their hypotheses, paving the way for targeted interventions.
                </p>

                <h4>Corrective Actions</h4>
                <p>Armed with validated hypotheses and a clear understanding of the underlying causes, the company acts
                    upon the safety concerns by adopting a multifaceted approach:</p>

                <h5>Equipment Maintenance and Upgrades</h5>
                <p>The maintenance department takes immediate action, prioritizing repairs on all malfunctioning tools
                    and machinery, with a particular focus on the problematic mixing machines. A preventive maintenance
                    program is established, including more frequent inspections, maintenance, and parts replacement. To
                    address the issue of spare parts availability, the company negotiates a contract with a local
                    supplier to ensure faster delivery times.</p>

                <p>Impact: Within three months of implementing the new maintenance program, equipment-related incidents
                    decrease by 40%, and downtime due to malfunctions is reduced by 25%.</p>

                <h5>Enhancing Training Programs</h5>
                <p>The HR department, in collaboration with the EHS team and frontline supervisors, revamps the safety
                    training program. New, more comprehensive training sessions are developed, with a strong emphasis
                    on hands-on learning for operating machinery and handling chemicals. The onboarding process for new
                    employees is redesigned to include a longer, more structured training period with dedicated mentors.
                    Training materials are updated to include specific procedures for handling the chemicals, and
                    refresher courses are implemented to reinforce safe practices.</p>

                <p>Impact: Six months after the training program overhaul, incidents involving new employees decrease by
                    30%, and there is a noticeable improvement in employee confidence and adherence to safety protocols.
                </p>

                <h5>Environmental Improvements</h5>
                <p>The company upgrades ventilation and cooling systems in high-risk areas. New exhaust fans and air
                    conditioning units are installed to improve airflow and reduce temperatures. Regular air quality
                    assessments monitor exposure levels to potentially harmful substances.</p>

                <p>Impact: Employee surveys conducted after the environmental improvements show a significant increase
                    in
                    worker satisfaction and a reduction in reported fatigue and heat-related discomfort. Incident rates
                    in the previously high-risk areas decrease by 20%.</p>

                <h5>Process and Procedure Review</h5>
                <p>The EHS team leads a comprehensive review of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for chemical
                    handling and equipment operation, combined with feedback and contributions from employees. The
                    revised SOPs incorporate clearer instructions, visual aids, and checklists, ensuring consistency and
                    reducing the risk of errors.</p>

                <p>Impact: The updated SOPs lead to a 15% reduction in chemical spill incidents and a noticeable
                    improvement in overall workplace safety compliance.</p>

                <p>This case study powerfully illustrates how diagnostic analytics can drive meaningful improvements in
                    workplace safety. By analyzing the 'why' behind the incidents, the company implemented targeted
                    interventions that addressed the root causes. Instead of relying on generic solutions or guesswork,
                    diagnostic analytics allowed the company to pinpoint specific areas needing attention. This led to
                    more effective corrective actions, resulting in a significant reduction in incidents and improved
                    overall safety performance.</p>

                <h3>The Crucial Role of Data Standardization</h3>
                <p>Standardizing accident data using the ESAW methodology was key to this initiative's success. This
                    ensured that all incidents were recorded consistently, using the same definitions and categories.
                </p>

                <p>Standardized data is essential for several reasons. Firstly, standardization allows for meaningful
                    comparisons of safety performance across different departments, time periods, and even with other
                    organizations using the same standards.</p>

                <p>Secondly, consistent data is crucial for accurate analysis and the identification of valid trends and
                    patterns. Without standardization, the results of the analysis can be skewed or misleading, making
                    it difficult to identify valid trends and patterns. Standardization ensures that the data is
                    reliable and can be used to draw meaningful conclusions.</p>

                <p>Thirdly, standardization facilitates clear communication across the organization and with external
                    stakeholders. It creates a common language and understanding, enabling clear and concise reporting,
                    discussions, and decision-making.</p>

                <h3>Achieving Data Standardization</h3>
                <p>Although this case study focused on ESAW, various other standards and frameworks can be used to
                    achieve
                    data standardization in workplace safety. Organizations can adopt industry-specific standards,
                    national guidelines, or develop their own internal classification systems.</p>

                <p>Key steps to achieving data standardization include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Selecting a Suitable Standard: Choose a standard that aligns with the organization's needs,
                        industry, and reporting requirements.</li>
                    <li>Developing Clear Definitions: Ensure that all data collectors understand the definitions and
                        categories used in the chosen standard.</li>
                    <li>Providing Training: Train employees involved in reporting on the proper use of the standard and
                        the importance of accurate data entry.</li>
                    <li>Using Specialized Software: Consider using specialized EHS software solutions that facilitate
                        standardized data collection, analysis, and reporting. These tools often include built-in
                        features for incident recording, investigation, and trend analysis, streamlining the entire
                        process.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>By prioritizing data standardization and leveraging the diagnostic analytics, organizations can
                    unlock
                    valuable insights, implement effective safety interventions, and create a safer and healthier work
                    environment for all. Diagnostic analytics empowers EHS professionals to move beyond reactive
                    measures and address the root causes of workplace incidents, fostering a proactive safety culture
                    and contributing to a more sustainable future.</p>
